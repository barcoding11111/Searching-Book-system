# Searching-Book-system
The database system I envision is a book search and recommendation system in Suwon-si, which allows users to conveniently search and recommend books when searching for books, and has the following functions.
1. Function for Search and available library display
If you search for the name of the library you want in Suwon-si, it shows the library's information (library name, address, phone number) that you can borrow based on the search date and search time, making it convenient to borrow books. This function is based on the search date and search time, so it can be used from 9:00 to 22:00 operated by the library.
2. Function that allows users to recommend books.
First, there is a search function based on the topic code of the book and the presence or absence of children. This function serves as a recommended book search function for parents with children to see books for children by entering the theme of the book (ex. novels). Also, if you are not a child, you can use it as a subject-specific search function.
The following function has a search function that allows you to check the book information from the entry of the year of publication in order of language. For example, if you enter 2022, you can check new books and make them visible to users in the order of the language written, adding convenience.
As the last function, when the user enters the desired age (ex. 2010s), the year of award and representative works of the Nobel Prize winner in the relevant age can be checked to help receive recommendations for books.
